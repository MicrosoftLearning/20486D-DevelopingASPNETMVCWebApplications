### Exercise 4: Architecting an MVC Web Application

#### Task 1: Hosting options.

1. On the taskbar, click the **DetailedPlanningDocument(docx) - Microsoft Word** icon.

2. In the **DetailedPlanningDocument(docx) - Microsoft Word** window, locate the Hosting Recommendations section, and then locate the Web Server section.

3. Under Web Server, type **The author recommends using Microsoft Azure to host the Photo Sharing application. Microsoft Azure can host any ASP.NET website, including the ASP.NET Core MVC application proposed in this document. Scaling is very simple because Microsoft, not Adventure Works, is responsible for adding server resources at times of high traffic. Costs are minimal: they depend on the amount of data served to visitors but it is not necessary to maintain our own hardware.**


#### Task 2: Choose a data store.

1. In the Database section of the **DetailedPlanningDocument(docx) - Microsoft Word** window, type **The author recommends using SQL Database, within Microsoft Azure, to host the Photo Sharing application underlying database. As for the web server, this recommendation ensures high-availability hosting for the database with good value for money.  This makes particular sense if the web site is hosted in Microsoft Azure.**

2. On the Quick Access Toolbar, click **Save**.

    >**Results** : After completing this exercise, you will be able to create proposals for hosting arrangements.
