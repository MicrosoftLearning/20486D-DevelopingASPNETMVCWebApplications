# Module 5: Developing Views

Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20486 repository resides. For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20486 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20486**, change the path: **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20486D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20486\AllFiles\20486D\Mod01**.

# Lab: Developing Views 

#### Scenario
To construct the user interface of a city's web application, your development team decided to add views. You have been asked to create the views to render a response to a browser.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Add an MVC view to a web application.
- Use Razor to differentiate server-side code from HTML code.
- Write HTML code and tag helpers in a view.
- Add partial views and view components.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **60 minutes**


### Preparation Steps

Ensure that you have cloned the **20486D** directory from GitHub. It contains the code segments for the labs and demos in this course. (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20486D-DevelopingASPNETMVCWebApplications/tree/master/Allfiles**)

## Exercise 1: Adding Views to an MVC Application

#### Scenario

To construct the user interface of a web application, views should be added to the web application. In this exercise you will add two views to the web application: **Index** and **Details**. The **Index** view will show a list of cities, and the **Details** view will show the details of a city.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1.	Add a view to show all the cities

2.	Run the application

3.	Add a view to show data for a city

4.	Add a Back link to a view

5.	Add a city name as a link to each city

6.	Run the application

####	Task 1: Add a view to show all the cities

1. From **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod05\Labfiles\01_CitiesWebsite_begin**, open the **CitiesWebsite.sln**. 

    >**Note**: If a **Security Warning for RazorSyntaxExample** dialog box appears, verify that the **Ask me for every project in this solution** check box is cleared, and then click OK.
