# Module 4: Developing Controllers

Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20486 repository resides. For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20486 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20486**, change the path: **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20486D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20486\AllFiles\20486D\Mod01**.

# Lab: Developing Controllers

#### Scenario

You have been asked to add controllers to a new application.
The controllers should include actions that return a view, also add an action that returns the photo as a .jpg file to show on a webpage, and an action that redirects to another action in another controller.
Additionally, you have been asked to configure routes in a variety of ways.

The members of your development team are new to ASP.NET Core MVC and they find the use of controller actions confusing. Therefore, you need to help them by adding a component that displays action parameters in an external file whenever an action runs. To achieve this, you will add an action filter.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Add an MVC controller to a web application.
- Write actions in an MVC controller that respond to user operations.
- Add custom routes to a web application. 
- Write action filters that run code for multiple actions.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **60 minutes**

### Preparation Steps

1. Ensure that you have cloned the **20486D** directory from GitHub (**https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/20486D-DevelopingASPNETMVCWebApplications/tree/master/Allfiles**). It contains the code segments for the labs and demos in this course.

2. Navigate to **[Repository Root]\Allfiles\Mod04\Democode\01_WorldJourney_begin**, and then open the **WorldJourney.sln**.

    >**Note**: If a **Security Warning for WorldJourney** dialog box appears, verify that the **Ask me for every project in this solution** check box is cleared, and then click OK.

3. In the **WorldJourney - Microsoft Visual Studio** window, on the **DEBUG** menu, click **Start Without Debugging**.

4. In Microsoft Edge, in the address bar, note the port number that appears at the end of the URL **http://localhost:[port]**. You will use the port number during this lab.

5. In Microsoft Edge, click **Close**.

### Exercise 1: Adding Controllers and Actions to an MVC Application

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will create the MVC controller that handles user operations. You will also add the following actions:

- **Index**. This action displays the **Index** view.
- **Display**. This action takes an ID to find a single **City** object. It passes the **City** object to the **Display** view.
- **GetImage**. This action returns the photo image from the service as a .jpg file.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:

1. Add controllers to an MVC application

2. Add actions to a controller

3. Change actions to get a parameter

4. Change an action to redirect to another action in another controller

5. Use a service

6. Store the result in a ViewBag property

4. Close Microsoft Edge.

#### Task 3: Register new routes in the routing table

1. In the **Startup** class, replace **app.UseMvcWithDefaultRoute**  with **app.UseMvc**.

2. In the **app.UseMvc** method, use the **MapRoute** method to add a custom route with the following information: 
    - Name: **TravelerRoute**
    - Template: **{controller}/{action}/{name}**
    - Defaults: **controller = "Traveler", action = "Index", name = "Katie Bruce"**
    - Constraints: **name = "[A-Za-z ]+"**

    >**Note**: You can replace the default name **Katie Bruce** with your name.

3. Use the **MapRoute** method to add another custom route with the following information: 
    - Name: **defaultRoute**
    - Template: **{controller}/{action}/{id?}**
    - Defaults: **controller = "Home", action = "Index"**
    - Constraints: **id = "[0-9]+"**

#### Task 4: Run the application and verify the new route works

1. Save all the changes.

2. Start the application without debugging.

2. Run the application and verify that the new routes work

#### Task 1: Apply custom routes to a controller by using attributes

1. In the **CityController** class, annotate the **Index** action with the **Route** attribute. Pass **"WorldJourney"** as a parameter to the **Route** constructor.

2. Annotate the **Details** action with the **Route** attribute. Pass **"CityDetails/{id?}"** as a parameter to the **Route** constructor.

#### Task 2: Run the application and verify the new routes work

1. Save all the changes.

2. Start the application without debugging.

3. Using the **Developer Tools**, move your cursor over the **Go Next** button and verify that the **href** attribute value in the **a** tag is **/WorldJourney**.

4. Click **Go Next**.

    >**Note**: Verify that the new route works. As a result of applying a custom route to **CityController** in the **Index** action by using attributes, **http://localhost:[port]/WorldJourney** should appear in the address bar.

5. Using the **Developer Tools**, move your cursor over the **Earth** image and verify that the **href** attribute value in the **area** tag is **/CityDetails/2**.

6. On the **Earth** image, click the **London** area. Note the red arrow at the center of the **Earth** image.

    >**Note**: Verify that the new route works. As a result of applying a custom route to a **CityController** in the **Details** action using attributes, **http://localhost:[port]/CityDetails/2** should appear in the address bar.

7. Close Microsoft Edge.

>**Results**: After completing this exercise, you can add custom routes to the **City** controller by using the **Route** attribute.
