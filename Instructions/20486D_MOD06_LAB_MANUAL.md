# Module 6: Developing Models

# Lab: Developing Models

#### Scenario

You are planning to create and code an MVC model that implements your plan for butterflies in the butterfliesâ€™ shop application. The model includes properties that describe butterfly. The model must enable the application to store uploaded butterflies.

#### Objectives

After completing this lab, you will be able to:

- Add new models to the application and add properties to the model.
- Add GET and POST actions that accept the new model information.
- Use display and edit data annotations in the MVC model to assign property attributes to views and controllers.
- Use Display, Editor and Form Helpers in the views.
- Use validation Data Annotations in the MVC model to assign property attributes to views and controllers.
- Add custom validation to the application.

#### Lab Setup

Estimated Time: **60 minutes**

### Exercise 1: Adding a Model

#### Scenario

In this exercise, you will:

- Add model classes to the web application.
- _Create (GET)_. This action creates a new Butterfly object and passes it to the Create view, which displays a form that the visitor can use to upload a butterfly and describe it.
- _Create (POST)_. This action receives a butterfly object from the Create view and saves the details.
