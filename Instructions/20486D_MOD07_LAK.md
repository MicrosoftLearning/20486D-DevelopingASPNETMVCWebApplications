# Module 7: Using Entity Framework Core in ASP.NET Core

Wherever a path to a file starts with *[Repository Root]*, replace it with the absolute path to the folder in which the 20486 repository resides. For example, if you cloned or extracted the 20486 repository to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20486**, change the path: **[Repository Root]\AllFiles\20486D\Mod01** to **C:\Users\John Doe\Downloads\20486\AllFiles\20486D\Mod01**
